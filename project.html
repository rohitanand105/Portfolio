            <p>Posted on June 06, 2024 by Rohit Anand</p>
            <p>
                Face Emotion Recognition is a Machine Learning Project in which the machine will identify the facial
                expressions of the Person who is using the application.

            </p>
            <p> In this the application will detect the facial expressions and Emotion of the person like
            <ul>
                <li>Happy</li>
                <li>Sad</li>
                <li>Angry</li>
                <li>confused</li>
                <li>Busy</li>
            </ul>

            Further changes can be made in this project like making it more accurate to decrease the drunk and drive accidents by analyzing the behaviour of the person who is driving any vehicle and report to the desired authority after confirmation that the person is drunk while driving the car.
